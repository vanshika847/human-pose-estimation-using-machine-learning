# So how does it work?
<b>MediaPipe uses TensorFlow Lite in the backend to perform pose estimation efficiently. The process begins with a person detection module, which identifies the region of interest (ROI) in the frame containing the human body. This cropped ROI is then passed to the pose estimator, which predicts the keypoints or landmarks within the human body. MediaPipe Pose Estimation detects a total of 33 keypoints on the body, including key regions such as the head, shoulders, elbows, wrists, hips, knees, and ankles.

<b>Key Features of MediaPipe Pose Estimation:
<b>1.3D Pose Estimation: MediaPipe Pose estimates the x, y, and z coordinates for each landmark, where:

1. x and y represent the 2D position of a landmark.
2. z gives the depth of a landmark relative to others, providing an indication of how far or close a specific point is to the camera.
This depth information allows for a more accurate understanding of body posture, enabling the model to detect and track poses in three-dimensional space.

2. Real-time Performance: MediaPipe Pose uses BlazePose, a cutting-edge research model, to achieve high-fidelity pose tracking. This solution is optimized for real-time inference, allowing it to run efficiently on a wide range of devices including mobile phones, desktops, and laptops.

3. Applications: The ability to detect keypoints in real-time is valuable across various use cases such as yoga, dance, fitness applications, and AR. These applications can utilize the pose landmarks for:

a) Quantifying physical exercises: Ensuring correct form and tracking progress over time.
b) Sign language recognition: Mapping hand gestures to text or speech.
c) Augmented Reality (AR): Overlaying digital elements on the human body based on pose data.

## Pose Estimation Quality

To assess the effectiveness of MediaPipe Pose, we evaluate the model using different datasets across various domains:

Yoga: Predicting the pose of individuals performing yoga.
Dance: Capturing dynamic movements in dance.
HIIT: Tracking physical exercise movements during high-intensity interval training.
These validation datasets help demonstrate the model's ability to detect keypoints consistently, even for individuals positioned 2-4 meters from the camera.

## Categories of human pose detection:


1.2D Pose Estimation: In 2D pose estimation, only x and y coordinates are predicted for each landmark. This does not provide information about joint angles, rotations, or the orientation of the human body.

2. 3D Pose Estimation: With 3D pose estimation, the model predicts the x, y, and z coordinates for each landmark, allowing for a more detailed representation of the human body's pose. It also enables the calculation of joint angles, providing insight into the orientation and posture of the individual.

3. Rigid Pose Estimation (6D Pose Estimation): This technique provides a complete 3D understanding of human pose, including rotation and orientation of the human body. It is often used for precise tracking in applications like robotics and AR.

4. Single Pose Estimation: A model designed for predicting the pose of one person at a time in an image or video.
   
5. Multi-Pose Estimation: A more advanced model that can predict multiple human poses simultaneously in the same image or video, enabling the detection of groups of people.

The output of a pose detection system, such as the one in OpenCV, typically includes:
Skeleton Visualization: A graphical skeleton is drawn over the human body using lines to connect the predicted keypoints.
Pose Confidence: Confidence scores that indicate how likely the model is that the detected pose is correct.
